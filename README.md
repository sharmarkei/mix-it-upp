# About the Mix It Up! application
The first, and last, liquor web application you will ever need before you enter into Alcoholics Anonymous.  The application was developed by Sharmarke Ibrahim, Andy Martin, Matt Staples, and Chris Stefan.

# Purpose
Mix It Up! is best utilized by people (animals, too, maybe?) who have a selection of liquor on-hand, but don't know their available drink options.  Tell Mix It Up! what alcohol is available to you and you'll get a list of possible drinks you can make.  You'll even get a list of drinks where you're only missing one ingredient.

# How to Use the Application and the expected results.
The user navigates to the Mix It Up! website and left-clicks once on the image of each item they have in their possession.  After the user has finished clicking on their choices, the user selects the "Mix It Up!" button at the bottom of the home page.

Next, the page page refreshes with a complete list of drink recipes containing all of the ingredients selected by the user. Each drink in the complete list displays a recipe.  Clicking on a drink in the list will open a receipt and a embedded YouTube video of how to make the drink. If the Mix It Up! site does NOT have any drink recipes matching the user's selection, the site returns a message of "Sorry, we have no recipes that exactly match your choices.".

In situations where the user's selected ingredients are short of no more than one ingredient for a recipe, the user will receive a list of recipes with the message, "Almost: X" where "X" is equal to a
drink recipe.

The user can click on the "Back" button to return to the home page and reselect drink ingredients or refresh the site's web page.  Only the second option will reset all of the items to a state of "unselected".
